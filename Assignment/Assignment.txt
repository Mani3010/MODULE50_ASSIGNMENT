Question 1:
A database is a structured collection of data that is stored and
managed in a way that allows for efficient retrieval, manipulation,
and management. It organizes data into tables (or other structures)
that can be easily queried and updated. Databases are designed to
handle large amounts of data and support multiple users accessing
and modifying the data simultaneously.
Need of Databases:
Efficient Data Management
Avoid Data Redundancy
Avoid Limited Access Control
Easy Querying and Reporting
-----------------------------****-------------------------------------
Question 2:
A file-based storage system manages data using files stored on a
computerâ€™s file system. Data is typically stored in plain text or
binary files, organized in directories or folders. Each file is an
independent unit of storage, and applications must handle file creation,
reading, updating, and deletion directly.
Major Challenges:
Data Redundancy and Inconsistency
Difficulty in Data Management
Lack of Scalability
Concurrency Issues
Complex Data Retrieval
-----------------------------****-------------------------------------
Question 3:
DBMS (Database Management System) is software that provides an interface 
for managing and interacting with databases. It allows users to create, update,
manage, and retrieve data efficiently while ensuring data integrity, security, and consistency.
DBMS abstracts the complexities of data storage and retrieval, making it easier for users to interact with data through 
structured queries and operations.
Why Was There a Need for DBMS?
Data Redundancy and Consistency
Efficient Data Management
Data Integrity
Security
-----------------------------****-------------------------------------
Question 4:
Challenges of File-Based Storage Systems Addressed by DBMS:
Data Redundancy and Inconsistency
Data Integrity
Efficient Data Management
Concurrency Control
Data Security
Backup and Recovery
Scalability
-----------------------------****-------------------------------------
Question 5:
classification in DBMS based on data models:
1. Relational Data Model
The relational data model organizes data into tables
(also called relations), each consisting of rows (tuples) and 
columns (attributes). Tables can be related to one another 
through keys.
2. Hierarchical Data Model
The hierarchical data model organizes data in a tree-like structure 
where each record has a single parent and zero or more children. 
It reflects a parent-child relationship.
3. Network Data Model
The network data model represents data in a graph structure where
entities can have multiple parent and child relationships,
allowing for more complex interrelationships.
4. Object-Oriented Data Model
The object-oriented data model stores data as objects,
 similar to object-oriented programming. Objects encapsulate
  both data and behaviors (methods).
  Classification Based on Number of Users
1. Single-User Database
A single-user database is designed for use by one person at a time.
 It is generally used in personal or small-scale applications
  where multiple simultaneous users are not required.
2. Multi-User Database
A multi-user database is designed to handle multiple users
 accessing and modifying the database simultaneously.
  It is used in environments where several users need to
   interact with the data concurrently.
Classification Based on Database Distribution
1. Centralized Database Systems
In a centralized database system, all data is stored and managed
 in a single central location or server. All database 
 operations, such as queries and updates, are handled by this
  central server.
2. Distributed Database Systems
In a distributed database system, data is distributed across
 multiple locations or servers. The system provides a unified 
 view of the data, despite its physical distribution.  
-----------------------------****-------------------------------------
Question 6:
Data modeling is a critical process in database design and management
 that involves creating a conceptual framework for how data is 
 organized, related, and stored. The significance of data 
 modeling includes:
Hierarchical Model: Organizes data in a tree structure with a single
 parent-child relationship. Suitable for hierarchical data but less
  flexible for complex relationships.
Network Model: Uses a graph structure to support many-to-many
 relationships and more complex data navigation. More flexible 
 but harder to manage.
Relational Model: Uses tables with rows and columns to represent 
data and relationships. It is flexible and widely used due to its
 support for complex queries and data integrity.
Physical Data Model: Focuses on how data is physically stored 
and optimized for performance and storage.
-----------------------------****-------------------------------------
Question 7:
Three-Schema Architecture
The Three-Schema Architecture is a framework designed to provide a
 clear separation of concerns in database systems, allowing for data
  abstraction and independence. It defines three levels of database
   schema to manage how data is stored, accessed, and viewed. The
    architecture aims to support data abstraction and independence
     by separating the physical storage details from the logical 
     structure and the user views of the data.
1. Internal Schema (Physical Schema)
 Defines how data is physically stored on the storage media
  (e.g., hard drives or SSDs). It describes the 
low-level data structures and access methods used by the database
 management system (DBMS).
2. Conceptual Schema (Logical Schema)
Purpose: Provides a unified view of the entire database. 
It describes the data model, including the relationships 
between data entities, without concerning itself with physical
 storage details.
3. External Schema
Represents different views or subsets of the data as seen by different
 users or user groups. It provides customized views of the data to
  meet specific user needs.
